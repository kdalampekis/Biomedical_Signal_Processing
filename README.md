# üß† EEG Classification using CSP and Machine Learning

This notebook implements a full EEG signal processing and classification pipeline based on the **EEGBCI dataset**, focused on **motor imagery** tasks.

It includes:
- Preprocessing EEG signals using the `MNE` library
- Selecting and renaming motor-related event annotations
- Extracting spatial features using **Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)**
- Applying machine learning classifiers (e.g. LDA, SVM) to detect motor intentions

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand EEG signal characteristics and preprocessing needs
- Learn how to extract discriminative features for brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
- Compare classification performance for left/right hand, fists/feet motor imagery
- Handle EEG data from multiple subjects using standardized MNE pipelines
